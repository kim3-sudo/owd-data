On taking over, news was received that Lieutenant H. Hulton-Harrop had been killed in the trenches during the day, just as the relief was completed. Second Liuetenant J.S.Woolley was wounded. Following officers were in trenches the night of 12-13th: Lieutenant Colonel the honourable A.R. Stanley D.S.O; Captain G.E.M. Mundy, Captain J.J. Astor; Captain R. Hamilton-Stubber; Captain and Adjutant the Honourable E.N. Wyndham; Captain Sir R.V. Sutton; Lieutenant G.H. Drummond; Second Lieutenant M. Seton-Karr; Second Lieutenant J.S. Woolley; Second Lieutenant T.R. Robson; Second Lieutenant S.C. Bostock; Surg. Lieutenant E.D. anderson. The left of the the position occupied by the regiment rested on the Ypres- Zonnebeke road and was some 150 yards in advance of the front trenches occupied by the Queens (RWS) on the north of the road. This was a  source of weakness, as the line could be infiltrated from some houses just past north of the road, which it was not easy to deny to the enemy - and they advance(d). Ths section of the line was occupied by 'B' squadron with 'D' squadron and headquarters in support trench 50 yards in rear. When regiment took over these two trenches were not joined by a communicating trench. This however was dug through the night. On the right of 'B' squadron was a gap in th line of some 150 yards in which a farm was situated. South of the fam was 'A' squadron, joinin gon the right with 2nd Life guards. One Machine Gun under Second Lieutenant Bostock was posted in 'B' squadron trench, the other with 20 men of 'A' squadron under Second Lieutenant M. Seton-Karr was posted on a farm 300 yards in rear of the position, to form a 'point l'affirm'.   (26,18)
